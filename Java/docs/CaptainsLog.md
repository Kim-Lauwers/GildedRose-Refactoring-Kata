# Captain's Log

## 17/04/2020 - Reverted the changes on Item
The Item object may not be changed. So reverted the changes.
Added a new object Product to encapsulate the Item object. I don't want my code to break when Item Object changes or at least want only one place to change it.

## 17/04/2020 - Introduction of ADR-Files
